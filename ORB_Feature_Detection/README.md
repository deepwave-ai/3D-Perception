# ORB Feature Detection
Overview

ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) can be used for feature detection anf matching. Hence it can also be also used for Visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping).


This implementation:

(1) Camera Initialization:

	The cv2.VideoCapture(0) initializes the video capture from the default camera (index 0).

(2) ORB Detector:

	cv2.ORB_create(): Initializes the ORB detector.

(3) Feature Detection and Description:

	orb.detectAndCompute(gray, None) detects keypoints and computes their descriptors.

(4) Keypoints Visualization:

	cv2.drawKeypoints() overlays detected keypoints on the original frame.

(5) Real-Time Display:

	The processed frame is displayed using cv2.imshow().

(6) Exit Condition:

	The loop exits when the user presses the q key.

Run and Interact

	Run the code in Python.
	Press q to stop the live feed.
	Keypoints will be displayed on the live video feed as small circles, potentially with additional visual features like orientation and scale.

Use Cases
	Real-time feature matching.
	Object detection and tracking.
	Real-time SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping).
