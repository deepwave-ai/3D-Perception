# SIFT SLAM
Overview

SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) can be used for feature detection anf matching. Hence it can also be also used for Visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping).

Using SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) with a live camera feed involves capturing frames from the camera, processing each frame with SIFT to detect and describe features, and visualizing the results in real time.

Implementation

(1) Camera Initialization:
	cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
	Captures video from the default camera. Replace 0 with the appropriate camera index or file path if needed.

(2) Frame Processing:
	Convert the frame to grayscale: cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
	Apply SIFT detection and descriptor computation: sift.detectAndCompute()

(3) Visualize Keypoints: 
	Use cv2.drawKeypoints() to overlay keypoints on the live video feed.

(4) Real-Time Display: Use cv2.imshow() to show the video with detected keypoints.

Run and Interact

	Press q to exit the live feed.
	Keypoints will appear on the live video as dots with additional visual information (e.g., scale and orientation).

Use Cases

	Feature tracking across frames.
	Live object recognition.
	Real-time SLAM or 3D mapping.
