Getting Started with the Velodyne VLP16 for SLAM

Welcome to the guide for using the Velodyne VLP16 LiDAR sensor for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). This README will help you set up the sensor, connect it to your system, and integrate it with popular SLAM frameworks like Cartographer or Hector SLAM.

Overview

The Velodyne VLP16 is a compact and lightweight 3D LiDAR sensor capable of generating detailed 3D maps with a 360° horizontal field of view. It’s ideal for applications in robotics, autonomous navigation, and environment mapping. This guide focuses on its use for SLAM workflows.

Prerequisites

Hardware Requirements

1. Velodyne VLP16 Sensor
2. Ethernet Cable (Gigabit recommended)
3. Computer/Host Device with:
(1) Ethernet Port
(2) Ubuntu 18.04/20.04 or other Linux distributions
(3) ROS1/ROS2 installed (ROS2 preferred for modern SLAM implementations)

Software Requirements

1. ROS Workspace with the following packages:
(1) velodyne_driver
(2) velodyne_pointcloud

2. A SLAM package like:
(1) Google Cartographer
(2) Hector SLAM
(3) LIO-SAM

Step 1: Hardware Setup
1. Connect the Sensor
(1) Plug one end of the Ethernet cable into the Velodyne VLP16 sensor and the other end into your computer.
(2) Ensure the sensor is powered using its power supply.

2. Configure Network Settings
The VLP16 has a default IP address (192.168.1.201) and communicates over UDP. You must configure your system to be on the same subnet:

Open your terminal and run:

sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.10/24 dev eth0

If eth0 can't be used, you may use ifconfig to see which one is for ethernet.

Verify the connection by pinging the LiDAR:

ping 192.168.1.201

If successful, you should see responses from the sensor. 

If not successful, you may manually set your IPv4 address to 169.254.1.1 for your host. Netmask is 255.255.255.0, and Gateway is 169.254.1.1. Then 169.254.1.2 will be LiDAR address. 

ping 169.254.1.2

or go to http://169.254.1.2

to access the control interface for LiDAR.

Step 2: Software Setup

1. Install ROS Velodyne Driver

Clone and build the Velodyne driver in your ROS workspace:

bash
Copy code
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne.git
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make

2. Launch the Velodyne Driver
Start the Velodyne driver to stream point cloud data:

roslaunch velodyne_pointcloud VLP16_points.launch

3. Verify Point Cloud Output

Use RViz to visualize the point cloud:

rosrun rviz rviz -f velodyne

Add a "PointCloud2" display and set the topic to /velodyne_points.

Step 3: Integrating with SLAM

1. Install SLAM Package
Choose a SLAM framework and follow its setup instructions. For example:

Google Cartographer

sudo apt install ros-<distro>-cartographer-ros

2. Launch SLAM Node

Run your selected SLAM algorithm with the LiDAR point cloud data. For Cartographer:

roslaunch cartographer_ros demo_velodyne.launch

3. Configure Sensor Transformations

Edit the SLAM configuration files to define the transform between the Velodyne and the robot's base link. For example:

TRAJECTORY_BUILDER_3D.num_accumulated_range_data = 1
POSE_GRAPH.optimization_problem.huber_scale = 5e2

Step 4: Recording Data

To save sensor data for offline mapping:

rosbag record /velodyne_points

Troubleshooting

Common Issues

1. No point cloud in RViz: Ensure the Ethernet connection is active and the topic /velodyne_points is being published.
2. IP Configuration issues: Verify the IP settings match the Velodyne sensor’s default subnet.
