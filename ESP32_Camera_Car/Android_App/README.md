Android App to Control ESP32 Camera Car

Overview

This Kotlin implementation of MainActivity for an Android application is designed to interact with an ESP32 device. It performs two key functions:

1. Displaying a Video Stream:

A WebView is used to load and display the live video feed from the ESP32 camera over HTTP.
Sending Commands:

2. Commands (e.g., control inputs like moving a car) are sent to the ESP32 using HTTP POST requests.

How It Works

1. Displaying the ESP32 Camera Feed:

The ESP32 provides a live video stream over HTTP.
The WebView in the app loads this stream from the ESP32's IP address (http://192.168.4.1).

2. Sending Control Commands:

The app communicates with the ESP32 through HTTP POST requests.
Each request specifies a command (like "MoveCar") and a value (e.g., "1" for moving forward).
The ESP32 interprets the commands and executes the corresponding actions (e.g., moving motors).

Benefits

1. Real-time Video Streaming: The WebView integrates seamlessly to display the ESP32's video feed.

2. Interactive Control: HTTP POST requests enable the Android app to control the ESP32, turning it into a remote controller.

3. Asynchronous Execution: Coroutines ensure the app remains responsive while handling network operations.
